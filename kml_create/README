CATALOG MAPS - image file creation

Scripts are in
/home/bob/impacts/projDir/catalog/scripts

Params files are in
/home/bob/impacts/projDir/catalog/params

Output written to
/home/bob/impacts/raw/images

Have not figured out how to name output files so they match required file
naming conventions.  Use 'rename' scripts in above scripts dir to rename
files before ftp to catalog.eol.ucar.edu

Also need to automate entire process for next deployment.

In the field, these scripts must be run locally from

   /home/snowband/impacts/git/lrose-impacts/projDir/catalog/scripts

You can run them all together with

    create_catMaps_all.py <start> <end>

The output goes to

    /media/usb/data/raw/images
