Original cron looked like this and ran as ldm on frosty:

* * 18,19 1 * csh -c "~ldm/local/bin/new_sat/timed_run.pl
20200118140000 20200119090200 ~ldm/local/bin/new_sat/testmeso.csh
true_color_night 1 YYYYMMDD HH
/home/disk/data/images/sat_east_meso_impacts

Change start and stop time and sector (1 or 2) and it should run.



To run an hours worth of images, just run this as user ldm.  Edit sector, date,
hour and output directory:

/home/disk/ldm/local/bin/new_sat/testmeso.csh true_color_night 2 20200125 14 /home/disk/bob/impacts/sat/M1colorTest



Rename files to

ops.goes_east.<datetime>.M1color.jpg

for IMPACTS field catalog.
